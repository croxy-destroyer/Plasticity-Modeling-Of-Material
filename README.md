# Plasticity-Modeling-Of-Material
Generating plasticity equation for a material from the given stress/strain data and then using a subroutine program to add it to origin and abaqus
A tensile test specimen was modeled and simulations were run on it by providing threedifferent data. These data were either used from the original stress strain or form themodeled data. All the stress strain graphs were plotted.
There was not much deviation in the original plotted stress strain curve with themodeled stress strain curve.
The UMAT curve had a lot of deviation as it was based on linear hardening model.
